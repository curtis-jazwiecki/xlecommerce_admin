     * must be timestamp.
     * The DisplayableOrderId will appear as the "order id" in those
     * materials, and the DisplayableOrderComment will appear as well.

     * will take a shipment to be transported from the fulfillment center
     * to the recipient, once shipped. no default.
     * The following shipping speeds are available for US domestic:
     * * Standard, 3-5 business days
     * * Expedited, 2 business days
     * * Priority, 1 business day
     * Shipping speeds may vary elsewhere.  Please consult your manual for published SLAs.

     * handled. default is FillOrKill.

     * before any items have started shipping, the entire order is
     * considered unfulfillable.  Once any part of the order has
     * started shipping, as much of the order as possible will be
     * shipped.

     * either be fulfilled or merchant-cancelled.
     * * FillAllAvailable fulfill as much of the order as possible.
